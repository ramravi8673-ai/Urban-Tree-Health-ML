## 📌 Overview

Urban trees are critical for environmental sustainability, air purification, and urban temperature regulation.

This project leverages Machine Learning to predict the health condition of urban trees based on physical attributes such as trunk diameter and stump diameter.

The solution includes:
- Model training pipeline
- Multi-model comparison
- Performance evaluation dashboard
- Interactive Streamlit web application
- ROC and AUC analysis
- Feature importance insights
- PDF report generation
- 
## 🎯 Problem Statement

Manual monitoring of millions of urban trees is inefficient and expensive.

This project aims to:

- Predict tree health (Good / Fair / Poor)
- Enable data-driven urban forest management
- Support sustainable city planning initiatives

## 🧠 Models Implemented

- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier (Final Selected Model)
- 
### Why Random Forest?
- Handles nonlinear relationships
- Reduces overfitting
- Supports multi-class classification
- Provides feature importance analysis
